# How to Use

1. Install Dependencies
```
 npm install
```
2. Configure the directory to store the private key file (data folder)
```
    cd data
```

3. Run the corresponding script using the appropriate command:
    - `npm run add-liquidity`
    - `npm run add-stake-lp`
    - `npm run cross-chain`

`npm run add-liquidity` automatically scans 6 chains and adds 1U to the liquidity pool for tokens with a balance greater than 1USDT and no LP holdings.

`npm run add-stake-lp` automatically scans 6 chains and stakes LP tokens.

`npm run cross-chain` manually controls cross-chain transactions between the 6 chains with an amount ranging from 0 to 0.2U.

# A Letter to Friends

Dear friends:

I hope to convey some important news about the studio I am in through this letter. As the leader of a blockchain L2 network project, I am well aware that this is an exciting industry. However, the current market conditions in the cryptocurrency world have been quite challenging,Due to the large amount of capital invested in the SEI network in the early stage, nearly 50,000 accounts did not receive any returns, leading our `Sky Studio` to face financial difficulties.

In those moments filled with disappointment and despair, I stand before the ruins of our studio, looking at this once familiar land, filled with a sense of tragedy deep within my heart.

We were once a dedicated legion, working tirelessly on scripts for the blockchain L2 network. We loved this industry and believed in the immense potential of blockchain technology. However, the twists of fate made our efforts seem insignificant. The downturn in the cryptocurrency market robbed us of hope, turning our long-term investments into bubbles, making it impossible for the studio to continue.

After careful consideration and discussion, we had to make a difficult decision. Due to the inability to pay salaries and the inability to recover ongoing investments, we have to announce the dissolution of the studio.

Nevertheless, `we have decided to release the scripts we developed for LayerZero as an open-source project for anyone who is interested`. These scripts represent years of hard work and technical expertise. Through this gesture, we hope to give back to the community and provide assistance to others working and researching in the field of blockchain. Feel free to use these scripts, which will be available for download at the following address:

I stand in the midst of the storm, surrounded by desolation, memories and sadness flooding my heart. I know that this is a story that was once filled with passion and now has to end tragically. The sacrifices of our youth have turned into dust and regrets, but we still believe that this sense of tragedy will become the driving force for our future endeavors.

It is when we fall, fail, and lose everything that we truly discover our strength. Although our studio may dissolve, the dreams and beliefs in our hearts will never extinguish. We hope that one day, this bitterness and pain will transform into valuable experiences, inspiring us to continue pursuing the glory of the blockchain world.

If you are that destined person, may you take up this baton of tragedy and continue the unfinished work we started. Even if others cannot understand our sacrifices, in our hearts, this once epic journey will forever shine brightly.

Furthermore, if you feel that our work has indeed been helpful to you, you have the option to support us. You can transfer some U to our address, which will have a positive impact and motivation on our team members, enabling us to continue making valuable contributions in this field.

[Provide address information]

Lastly, I want to express my special gratitude to all the partners and community members who have supported us. Your support and trust have allowed us to move forward, and we will always cherish this time. Although the studio is about to dissolve, our journey in the blockchain world is not ending. Each one of us will continue to strive, seeking new opportunities and paths.

Thank you for your companionship and attention all this time. The era of cryptocurrency has come to an end, and I am exiting. It has been a pleasure to know all of you. Life is full of dreams, and each of us has our own brilliance. May our tragic melody forever resonate in the world of blockchain, accompanying us in our unfinished mission!
